# React Workshop Demo

## Setup
You'll need a Google Books api key in order to use this app.  You can get one at: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using.

Once you've got your key, create a .env file in the root of the project and add the key to it like this:

    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=<api key here>
